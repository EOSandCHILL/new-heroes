Heroes Guiding Heroes is an online application that allows active duty transitioning military members to get the online resources they need to excel in their civilian life after the military. When I went through my transitioning process it was long, dry and boring. I could barely remeber everything i was told and the paper documents i received from transitioning speakers were damaged after a while so I had to find what i was looking for online. Since I found what I was looking for online using several different online resources I thought it would be a great and useful idea to bring all the resources I needed as a veteran into one resourceful website which is how i started Project Heroes Guiding Heroes!

1. This application will allow users to find resources for transitioning, family support, mental health, and tech jobs for veterans.

2. This application will give users the top 6 most resourceful pages for the US Military community in 2022 which are benefits, careers, disabilities, education, health, and records.

What does the future look like for Project Heroes Guiding Heroes?

1. More resources
2. A military community where questions can be asked and answered
3. A FAQ section
4. Tech Jobs and programs for transitioning members and veterans
5. Resources to a mental health hotline
6. mobile/responsive update
